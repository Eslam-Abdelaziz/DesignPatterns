## Overview

This project is designed for self-learning and demonstration of design patterns in C#. Each pattern is implemented in a dedicated folder with clear, commented code and console-based examples.

## Pattern Types

### Creational Patterns
- **[Pattern Name]**
  - *Example 1*: Description of the example.
  - *Example 2*: Description of the example.

### Structural Patterns
- **[Pattern Name]**
  - *Example 1*: Description of the example.
  - *Example 2*: Description of the example.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**
  - *Amazon Product Subscription*: Users subscribe to a product (e.g., PlayStation 5). When the product is back in stock, all subscribed users are notified.
  - *Blog and Newsletter Subscription*: Users can subscribe to either blogs or newsletters. When new content is published, only the relevant subscribers are notified.

## Examples

### Observer Pattern

#### Amazon Product Subscription

Users can subscribe to a product (e.g., PlayStation 5). When the product is back in stock, all subscribed users are notified.

#### Blog and Newsletter Subscription

Users can subscribe to either blogs or newsletters. When new content is published, only the relevant subscribers are notified.

*Add similar sections for other patterns and their examples as you implement them.*

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK installed.

## How to Run

1. Build the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Set the desired project (e.g., `Observer Pattern`) as the startup project.
3. Run the project (`F5` or `Ctrl+F5`).

The console will display examples for each implemented pattern.
